Description
Keep visitors on your website longer and get more traffic on your website by inviting your visitors to read random posts! It’s easy! Just install the randomPost plugin, and select the random URL slug you want to use. This URL slug will redirect your users to a random post of yours! We recommend using the word “random” as your URL slug, but the option exists to use any slug you’d like. Once cosdnfigured, add the new URL with the slug to your menu as a custom link. That alone will invite visitors to stick around.

To add on top of that, we’ve added a configurable hotkey! If a visitor presses R on their keyboard, it’ll automatically load a random post! You can change the hotkey to be any key you’d like. To add a little more fun to your website, put a notice telling visitors to “Press R to read a random post”.

Features:

Easily change the URL for the random post redirect.
Easily change the hotkey for the keyboard shortcut to read a random post.
Easily enable or disable the hotkey function.
Uninstalling the plugin will clean up all data it has stored in the WordPress database.

## human_choice = "rock" or "paper" or "scissors" computer_choice = "rock" or "paper" or "scissors"

 1. INSERT HERE YOU CHOICE -- >
 2. human_choice = "paper"


## INSERT HERE THE COMPUTER'S CHOICE

computer_choice = "rock"

#DRAW -- >

 - if human_choice == 'rock' and computer_choice == 'rock':
  print("This is draw!")
  



if human_choice == 'paper' and computer_choice == 'paper':
  print("This is draw!")

if human_choice == 'scissors' and computer_choice == 'scissors':
  print("This is draw!")

*That is pretty much how far I got.* 



Here is a list of what i should have done to be successful in this project;

 1. pay closer attention
 2. ask more questions
 3. give myself a lot of time to complete a project
 4. pay closer attention

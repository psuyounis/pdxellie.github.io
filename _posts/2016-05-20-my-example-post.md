Description
Most people have used performance enhancement drugs in one way or another. Most us drink coffee, eat low carb foods and supplement when we are low on a mineral. We ingest heart medication to reduce the chances of a stroke, we take insulin to control our glucose levels, and we drink vitamin enhanced milk.

Any drug can be harmful if not probably used and administered by a qualified person. There have been numerous reported cases of Tylenol overdoses in the US. More than 100,00 reported cases of emergency room visits, hospitalization and even 484 deaths due to the potential side effect of Tylenol (“Acetaminophen”).  Tylenol, just like other sport enhancement drugs should be carefully administered and monitored. Due to the ban on Steroids and other drug enhancements, a black market was created where athletes that choose to use banned substances, self-administer drugs without a qualified person's recommendation and guidelines.
This practice of self-administered PE has led to unqualified people using a substance with no guidelines. To reduce negative side-effects of PE, we can create appropriate guidelines for performance enhancements to aid athlete’s administration and improve health outcomes and create fairness within sports. Steroids can be dangerous if not administered correctly. However, the dangers arise from abuse and overdose, and to reduce negative outcomes an athlete would be monitored by a health care provider and routine blood work would flag any undesirable levels.
